# Basic Website

This repo contains the template for a basic web project using Gulp, SASS, and
ES6.

Run `npm install` to get ready, then `gulp` to start working. The site will be
built in the `dst` directory. Put your SASS in `src/styles` and your javascript
in `src/scripts`.

Not finished yet, media's not handled completely and javascript dependancies
aren't added automatically.
